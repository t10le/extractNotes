# extractNotes
A shell script designed to simplify the process of extracting and perdiocally updating course material from an institution's network.\
No more typing – just execute!

This particular script accesses Ryerson University's Moon server to automatically extract ALL of a specified course's data, and then stores it at the current location of where this script resides in.

The login credentials are stored **locally**, so ensure that any local users do not have access to this file, or they will be able to see the hardcoded sensitive information!
